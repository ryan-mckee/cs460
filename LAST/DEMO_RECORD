sh wasn't able to get to a working state. The other programs were made to interact with the default sh and work, but my sh doesn't have pipes/io redirection.
All it can do is run simple commands and exit/logout
The functionality of the other programs with piping and io redirection can be tested if sh is omitted from mk and compiled with a fresh sdimage

============================================================================

 Commands             Expected Results                 Observed & Comments
-------------    --------------------------------    -----------------------
1. Boot up     :  P1 (init) create login processes  the console displays that 3 login processes were created. The terminals have login prompts

2. login:      :  login from tty0                  the login console rejects attempts made with invalid information. When presented with valid information, it enters into the sh program

3.             :  login from ttyS0, ttyS1          the login console on the terminal rejects attempts made with invalid information.
                                                   When presented with valid information, it enters into the sh program. Multiple login sessions
                                                   are able to be open simulaneously, even on the same account

               :  logout; login again              logging out returns to the login screen on the console. When presented with valid login information it enters the sh program again

sh: Control-C  :  sh must not die                  ___________________________Unable to get sh to a working state, sh dies

4. ls          :  SAME as ls -l in Linux,          ls displays the files, their permissions, and size. Works in the current/relative directory, or otherwise
                  except no time field  
5. cat         : show input lines from stdin:      every time enter is pressed, the line from the console is printed

6. cat f       : show contents of file f           the contents of f are printed if it exists. The program was also coded to print multiple files like cat actually can

7. cat f1 > f2 
   ls          : f1, f2 MUST be SAME size          ___________________________Unable to get sh io redirection working

8  grep abcd    :  grep for abcd from stdin

9. grep printf f: show lines with "printf" ONLY    parses through the file line by line, searching for the pattern. If the line is found, prints it out. can perform this on multiple files
                                                   like grep actually can

10. more f      : MUST pause after display ONE screen
                : Enter key: advance by line 
                 : SPACE key: advance by screen     if a file is less than 25 lines it prints the whole file. If it is longer it waits for user input.
                                                    Pressing enter prints another line. pressing space prints another 25 lines. The program ends when the file ends

11. cat f | more : must PAUSE for Enter/Space keys  ___________________________Unable to get sh pipes working. This was tested with the default sh
                                                    pressing enter twice advances the progress in the file by one line. Pressing space advances the progress by a screen


12. cat f | grep printf : show lines with printf   ___________________________Unable to get sh pipes working. This was tested with the default sh
                                                   prints the lines in the file f that have 'line' in them


13. cat f | l2u | grep PRINT: outputs all uppercase   ___________________________Unable to get sh pipes working. This was tested with the default sh
                                                      prints the lines in the file f, modified to be capitalized, that have 'LINE' in them


14. cat f | cat | l2u | grep LINE: 3 PIPEs      ___________________________Unable to get sh pipes working. This was tested with the default sh
                                                prints the lines in the file f, modified to be capitalized, that have 'LINE' in them


15. cat < f | cat | grep print > out :        __________________________________Unable to get sh pipes working
    cat out (must see out contents)           __________________________________Unable to get sh pipes working

16. cp f g; ls :   show f and g SAME size     the files are the same size. Their contents are also identical when checked with cat
